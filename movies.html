	<h2>Storyline</h2>
	<p>Harry Potter shapes an entire generation. It has become a household name and nearly everyone knows about the boy wizard and his two best friends, Ron and Hermione. The stories span seven years, coinciding with the seven years a student spends at Hogwarts. Specifically, these book span Harry's seven years at Hogwarts.

The first book begins at the beginning of Harry's life. Harry, at 15 months old, was orphaned and left on his Aunt and Uncle's front door. We learn that Harry is indeed magical, but his new family is not. Fast forward 10 years and Harry is a small, neglected, and shy 11-year-old who lives in the cupboard under the stairs. He is told repeatedly that he is not worthy of the Dursley's (his aunt, uncle, and rotund cousin) love. Suddenly, letters begin arriving for Harry. Despite the Dursley's best attempts, he learns of Hogwarts, the magical school in the UK, and decides to attend. Harry has many adventures at his new school, meeting friend (Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley) and foe (Draco Malfoy and Professor Severus Snape) alike. The first book is amazing alone, yes, but it truly serves to set the stage for the rest of Harry's education.

The second book begins at the Dursley's again. Harry is trapped without being able to contact his friends. Ron, however, soon comes to his rescue in a flying car. Harry travels to Ron's house and meets most of his family, three of his older brothers he knew from Hogwarts, his younger sister, and his father. The two go back to Hogwarts and learn the school is under attack, and his professor is unable to stop it. Nearly single-handedly, Harry fights to save the only home he's ever known.

<h2>Story line</h2>
<p>Reed Richards, a brilliant but timid and bankrupt scientist, is convinced that evolution can be triggered by clouds of cosmic energy, and has calculated that Earth is going to pass one of these clouds soon. Together with his friend and partner, the gruff yet gentle astronaut muscle-man Ben Grimm, Reed convinces his conceited MIT classmate Dr. Victor Von Doom, now CEO of his own enterprise, to allow him access to his privately-owned space station. Von Doom agrees in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. He thus brings aboard Susan Storm, his shy, though assertive chief genetics researcher and a former lover of Reed's with whom she had an acrimonious break-up, and her diametrically opposed brother Johnny, the maverick and hot-headed playboy pilot. The astronauts make it home intact; however, before long they begin to mutate, developing strange and amazing powers as a result of their exposure to the cloud</p>

<h2>Storyline</h2>
<p>Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. To say his life is "miserable" is an understatement. But one day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined. Peter acquires a muscle-bound physique, clear vision, ability to cling to surfaces and crawl over walls, shooting webs from his wrist ... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.</p>
